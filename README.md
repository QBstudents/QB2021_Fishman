## Bio

I am a second year PhD student in the the Lennon Lab. I study the interactions between phage and their microbial hosts, and I am particularly interested in how various traits, such as mutation rate, and spatial features, alter coevolutionary dynamics. My favorite animal is the giant squid (Architeuthis), and my GitHub profile has a picture of a preserved specimen and myself at a museum in Brisbane.

## Course Expectations

1. Learn multivariate statistical methods
2. Apply phylogenetic analysis to data sets
3. Collaborate on a computational project with peers
4. Have fun!
